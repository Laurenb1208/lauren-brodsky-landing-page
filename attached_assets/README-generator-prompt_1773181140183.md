# Generating a Project README with an LLM

**BAIS:3300 — Digital Product Management**

A README.md file is the front door to your project repository. It tells anyone who visits your repo what the project does, how to run it, and how it was built. This guide walks you through how to use an LLM (like Claude or ChatGPT) to generate a professional README for your own project.

---

## Step 1 — Provide Your Project Context

You have two options for giving the LLM information about your project. Use whichever fits your situation.

### Option A — Create it in Replit

If you're building in Replit, the AI will already have the context and details necessary to build the README.md file.

### Option B — Share a Link to Your GitHub Repository

If your repository is **public**, you can paste the URL directly into the chat:

`Here is my GitHub repository: https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name. Please let me know if you can read the files.`

If the LLM can read your files it can use them to write accurate, specific content for each section.

### Option C — Upload Your Files

If your repository is **private** or if the LLM can't read your repository, upload the files that best describe your project:

1. Upload your
   - index.html & stylesheet.css
   - PRD.md
   - STANDARDS.md
   - A screenshot of your running application (optional but helpful)

---

## Step 2 — Prompt to create the README.md

Read and edit the prompt below. Copy the prompt and paste it into the AI.

---

### The Prompt

````
I need you to generate a professional README.md file for my project repository.
I have [shared my GitHub repository link / uploaded my project files] above.

Review the project and generate a complete README.md file using the following
sections. Write the content in Markdown format so it can be displayed in GitHub.

Use the actual details of my project — do not use generic placeholder text.
Every section should reflect what my project actually does.

---

Include the following sections in this order:

1. BADGES
   - A row of shields.io badges at the top reflecting the languages and license used.
   - Use flat style.
   - Generate the correct badge URLs based on my tech stack.
   - Include this "vibe coded" badge: ![Vibe Coded badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?message=Vibe%20Coded&labelColor=5c5c5c&color=7c3aed&logoColor=white&label=%20&style=for-the-badge&logo=data:image/svg+xml;base64,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)

Format requirements:
- Output only the Markdown content — no explanations before or after
- Use ATX-style headings (# not underlines)
- Use fenced code blocks (``` not indented) for all code and terminal commands
- Use italics for template guidance hints below each section heading so I know
  what to change if I reuse this as a template later

## Step 3 — Review and Customize

After the LLM generates the README, do the following before committing it to your repo:

1. **Read every section** — make sure nothing is inaccurate or generic
2. **Fill in any gaps** — the LLM may leave placeholders if it couldn't find certain details
3. **Update the Author and Contact sections** with your actual information
4. **Check the badges** — paste the badge URLs into a browser to confirm they render correctly
5. **Add a LICENSE file** — go to your GitHub repo, click _Add file_, and choose _Create new file_. Name it `LICENSE`, then click _Choose a license template_ and select MIT.

---

### Tips for Better Results

- The more context you provide, the better the output. A public GitHub link is ideal.
- If the LLM gets something wrong, just say: _"The tech stack is actually HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks."_
- You can ask follow-up questions like: _"Can you make the description more concise?"_ or _"Add a screenshot placeholder to the Usage section."_
- Save the prompt — you can reuse it.
